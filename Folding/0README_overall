Explanation for seqid.all_in_one.zip
In this package, except image files and .pkl files, all the other files are in plain text format.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

0README_overall       : This README file

seqid		      : the ID assigned by the server to the query sequence

seqid.fasta           : the user input sequence in FASTA format

seqid.a2m             : Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) in A2M format
seqid.a3m             : Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) in A3M format

seqid.predictedDistMatrix.pkl	: this file contains predicted contact/distance/orientation information. It is a tuple of 6 items and the first 4 items are seqName, primarySeq, predicted distance/orientation prob matrix, predicted contact matrix.
			The 3rd and 4th items are python dictionary with keys like 'CbCb', 'NO', 'CaCa'. With key 'CbCb', you may obtain the predicted Cb-Cb distance probability matrix in the 3rd item and the predicted Cb-Cb contact probability matrix in the 4th item. 
		        The 3rd item also has predicted probability matrix for inter-residue orientation.

seqid.gcnn	      : predicted contact matrix in text format

seqid.rr	      : predicted contact file in the CASP format. See https://predictioncenter.org/casp14/index.cgi?page=format#RR for its format

seqid.png and seqid_[1/2/3/4/5].png            : image files for the predicted contact matrix
seqid_dist.png and seqid_[1/2/3/4/5]_dist.png  : image files for the predicted distance matrix

seqid.pairPotential.DFIRE16.pkl: distance potential used by our new threading program DeepThreader and model quality assessment software ResNetQA. This potential is not used for folding, though.
seqid.epad_prob:	distance probability used by our old threading program DeepThreader

models/               : The folder contains the predicted five 3D models.
  0README             : a README file

  seqid_model_X.pdb   : The predicted 3D model files in PDB format, where X ranges from 1 to 5.

  seqid.model_summary : The file contains estimated erro in Angstrom of the predicted 3D models, which may not be very accurate for a multi-domain protein.

  seqid_modelX.localQuality.txt	: the file contains estimated error in Angstrom per Ca atom. Again, it may not be accurate for a multi-domain protein.
